# conzip
`conzip` is a python tool that aims to make publishing conlang grammars to pdf and html from yaml, csv, plain text, and other tex sources. yaml sources define the various chapters and text in them while referencing tables defined in csv or sections in plain text. Extra tex sources are used to parameterize packages, define new commands, and other more tex direct needs.
